      <description>0. Introduction 
For project 2, I decided to work with data derived from the popular MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) League of Legends as developed by Riot. In this video game, players select unique champions to combat other players in team-based matches. I thought it would be fascinating to see the relationships between the many variables that the game has to offer with their diverse cast of playable champions.</description>

0. Introduction 
For this project, I chose to work with two datasets. The first dataset is called netflix and it is composed of 50 days of my Netflix viewing history compiled into three columns: Date, Genre, and Run-time. They were acquired from the Netflix website through their download history function; however, the genres assigned to each of the observations were determined by the genre tags that Netflix auto-assigned them.</description>
